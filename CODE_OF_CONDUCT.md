# Code of Conduct

We want this project to be a welcoming and collaborative space for everyone who contributes code, documentation, or discussion. To keep interactions positive and focused on the project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Be respectful and courteous.  
2. Use clear, constructive language when giving feedback.  
3. Avoid personal attacks, insults, or derogatory remarks.  
4. Keep discussions and contributions relevant to the project; avoid political or ideological topics.  
5. Do not politicize issues; proposals should focus on technical merit and project goals.  
6. If you disagree, discuss ideas, not people.  

Any behavior that violates these principles—harassment, hate speech, trolling, or attempts to push unrelated political agendas—may result in removal of comments, denial of contributions, or blocking from the project.

Thank you for helping maintain a collaborative and focused community.
